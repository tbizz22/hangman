This was a fun homework. Unfortunately due to having to travel out of town it remains unfinished. While I feel comfortable with the material and what I would need to do to get this complete, I unfortunately needed a bit more time. If given the time I would obviously spend some time updating the UI and adding in a few more features, however the core components of a hangman game are all here. There are a few lingering gremlins that I dont have the time to debug through. 




I have a known issue in the footer of the page. The incorrect guess array is not displaying properly
