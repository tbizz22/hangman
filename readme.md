Open Issues:

Only highlighting first letter
not handling upper/lower
UI elements not showing appropriately
Kill the console logs 
how to handle spaces in UI






Enhancements 
Better UI
make text not selectable(kind of defeats the purpose)
have player only guess last name
multiple rounds of guessing
